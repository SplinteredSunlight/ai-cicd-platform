## 🔧 Development Setup

### AI Pipeline Generator Service

1. Navigate to the service directory:
   ```bash
   cd services/ai-pipeline-generator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
   ```

5. Run the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. Access the API documentation:
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Running Tests

```bash
cd services/ai-pipeline-generator
pytest tests/
```
