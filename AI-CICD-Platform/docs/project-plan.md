- **API Versioning**: Support versioned APIs for backward compatibility **Status: ‚úÖ Completed**

**Next Steps:**
1. Design enhanced authentication flow
2. Implement tiered rate limiting
3. Develop caching strategy
4. Design API versioning system

### 5. Frontend Dashboard Enhancements

**Status: Planned**

The user interface can be improved for better usability:

- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates **Status: ‚úÖ Completed**
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Add more charts and graphs for pipeline metrics **Status: ‚úÖ Completed**
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to customize their dashboard views **Status: ‚úÖ Completed**
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the UI works well on mobile devices **Status: ‚úÖ Completed**

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
2. Design and implement advanced visualization components
3. Create customizable dashboard framework
4. Implement responsive design for mobile devices

## Implementation Approach

For each enhancement area, we will follow this process:

1. **Design**: Create detailed specifications for the enhancement
2. **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Implementation**: Develop the feature with clean, maintainable code
4. **Review**: Conduct code reviews to ensure quality
5. **Integration**: Ensure the enhancement works with other components
6. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation, including:
   - README files
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Architecture diagrams
7. **GitHub**: Push changes to GitHub with descriptive commit messages
