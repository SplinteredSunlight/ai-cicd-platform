# Policy-as-Code Framework

The Policy-as-Code Framework allows users to define, enforce, and manage security policies as code, making security requirements explicit, versionable, and testable. This enhances the platform's security governance capabilities and helps organizations maintain consistent security standards across their CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

The Policy-as-Code Framework consists of the following components:

1. **Policy Definition Language**: A YAML-based schema for defining policies
2. **Policy Engine**: Evaluates policies against resources
3. **Policy Enforcer**: Enforces policies in CI/CD pipelines
4. **Policy Validator**: Validates policy syntax and semantics
5. **Policy Manager**: Manages policy lifecycle and versioning
6. **Compliance Reporter**: Generates compliance reports and remediation guidance

## Policy Definition Language

Policies are defined using a YAML-based schema that includes the following elements:

- **Metadata**: ID, name, description, version, etc.
- **Type**: Security, compliance, or operational
- **Enforcement Mode**: Blocking or warning
- **Environments**: Development, testing, production, etc.
- **Rules**: Conditions that must be satisfied for policy compliance

### Policy Schema

```yaml
id: <unique-policy-id>
name: <policy-name>
description: <policy-description>
type: <security|compliance|operational>
enforcement_mode: <blocking|warning>
status: <active|inactive|deprecated>
environments:
  - <environment-name>
tags:
  - <tag-name>
version: <semantic-version>
rules:
  - id: <rule-id>
    name: <rule-name>
    description: <rule-description>
    severity: <critical|high|medium|low|info>
    condition: <condition-expression>
    remediation_steps:
      - <remediation-step>
```

### Condition Expressions

Conditions can be simple field comparisons or complex logical expressions:

```yaml
# Simple condition
condition:
  field: <field-path>
  operator: <equals|not_equals|greater_than|less_than|contains|not_contains|exists|not_exists>
  value: <value>

# Complex condition
condition:
  operator: <and|or|not>
  conditions:
    - <condition-expression>
    - <condition-expression>
```

## Policy Enforcement

Policies can be enforced at different stages of the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit**: Validate policies before code is committed
2. **Build**: Enforce policies during the build process
3. **Deployment**: Enforce policies before deployment
4. **Runtime**: Continuously monitor and enforce policies in production

### Enforcement Modes

- **Blocking**: Policy violations prevent the pipeline from proceeding
- **Warning**: Policy violations generate warnings but allow the pipeline to continue

### Policy Exceptions

Policy exceptions can be defined for specific cases where a policy should not be enforced:

```yaml
exceptions:
  - id: <exception-id>
    description: <exception-description>
    expiration: <expiration-date>
    approved_by: <approver-name>
    resources:
      - <resource-id>
```

## Policy Validation and Testing

Policies can be validated and tested before enforcement:

1. **Syntax Validation**: Ensure policies conform to the schema
2. **Semantic Validation**: Ensure policies are logically consistent
3. **Policy Simulation**: Test policies against resources without enforcement
4. **Policy Unit Testing**: Write tests for policy rules

### Policy Testing Example

```yaml
tests:
  - name: <test-name>
    description: <test-description>
    resource:
      <resource-definition>
    expected_result: <pass|fail>
    expected_violations:
      - <rule-id>
```

## Policy Management

Policies are managed throughout their lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Define new policies
2. **Versioning**: Track policy changes
3. **Approval**: Review and approve policy changes
4. **Deployment**: Deploy policies to environments
5. **Deprecation**: Phase out obsolete policies

### Policy Versioning

Policies use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible additions
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible fixes

## Compliance Reporting

The framework generates compliance reports based on policy evaluations:

1. **Compliance Status**: Overall compliance status
2. **Violation Reports**: Details of policy violations
3. **Remediation Guidance**: Steps to address violations
4. **Compliance Trends**: Changes in compliance over time

### Compliance Report Example

```json
{
  "policy_id": "<policy-id>",
  "resource_id": "<resource-id>",
  "timestamp": "<timestamp>",
  "status": "<compliant|non-compliant>",
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule_id": "<rule-id>",
      "severity": "<severity>",
      "message": "<violation-message>",
      "remediation_steps": [
        "<remediation-step>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Examples

### Security Policy Example
