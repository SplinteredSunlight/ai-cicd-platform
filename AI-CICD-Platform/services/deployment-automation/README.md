# Deployment Automation Service

The Deployment Automation Service is a comprehensive solution for automating the deployment of applications to various environments. It provides capabilities for deployment pipeline generation, approval workflows, rollback and recovery mechanisms, deployment monitoring, and integration with common deployment targets.

## Features

### Deployment Pipeline Generation
- Templates for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Deployment strategy selection (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Deployment scheduling and timing controls
- Environment validation pre-deployment

### Approval Workflows
- Multi-level approval processes
- Role-based approval permissions
- Notification systems for pending approvals
- Audit logging for approval actions
- Automated approval based on predefined criteria

### Rollback and Recovery
- Automated rollback triggers
- Snapshot and backup mechanisms
- State verification for successful deployments
- Partial rollback capabilities for microservices
- Recovery testing

### Deployment Monitoring
- Deployment health checks
- Performance baseline comparison
- User impact analysis
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Deployment success metrics

### Deployment Target Integration
- Kubernetes deployment automation
- Cloud provider integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Serverless deployment capabilities
- On-premises deployment support
- Database migration automation

## Architecture

The service is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Deployment Pipeline Generator**: Creates deployment pipelines for different environments and strategies.
- **Approval Workflow**: Manages approval processes for deployment gates.
- **Rollback Manager**: Handles rollback and recovery mechanisms.
- **Deployment Monitor**: Monitors and verifies deployments.
- **Target Integrator**: Integrates with various deployment targets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Access to deployment targets (Kubernetes, cloud providers, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/ai-cicd-platform.git
   cd ai-cicd-platform/services/deployment-automation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

### Running the Service

#### Local Development

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t deployment-automation -f Dockerfile.dev .
docker run -p 8000:8000 deployment-automation
```

## API Documentation

Once the service is running, you can access the API documentation at:

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Deployment Pipeline

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pipelines" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-application",
    "environment": "staging",
    "strategy": "blue-green",
    "source": {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git",
      "branch": "main"
    },
    "target": {
      "type": "kubernetes",
      "namespace": "staging"
    }
  }'
```

### Triggering a Deployment

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pipelines/{pipeline_id}/deploy" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "parameters": {
      "replicas": 3,
      "resources": {
        "cpu": "500m",
        "memory": "512Mi"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Approving a Deployment

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/approvals/{approval_id}/approve" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user": "john.doe@example.com",
    "comment": "Approved after testing"
  }'
```

### Triggering a Rollback

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/rollback" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Performance degradation detected",
    "strategy": "full"
  }'
```

## Configuration

The service can be configured using environment variables or a `.env` file. See `.env.example` for available configuration options.
