# Task: Implement Remediation API Endpoints

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:05:00

## Background
The Automated Remediation feature requires a set of API endpoints to expose its capabilities to clients. These endpoints will allow users to create remediation plans, execute remediation actions, manage approvals, handle rollbacks, and monitor remediation status. The API should be RESTful, well-documented, and integrate with the existing API router.

## Task Description
Implement the remediation API endpoints in the `api/remediation_api.py` file. These endpoints should provide a comprehensive interface to the Automated Remediation system's functionality.

## Requirements

### API Endpoints
- Implement the following endpoints:
  - `POST /api/remediation/plans`: Create a new remediation plan
  - `GET /api/remediation/plans`: List all remediation plans
  - `GET /api/remediation/plans/{plan_id}`: Get a specific remediation plan
  - `POST /api/remediation/plans/{plan_id}/execute`: Execute a remediation plan
  - `GET /api/remediation/actions`: List all remediation actions
  - `GET /api/remediation/actions/{action_id}`: Get a specific remediation action
  - `POST /api/remediation/actions/{action_id}/execute`: Execute a remediation action
  - `GET /api/remediation/workflows`: List all remediation workflows
  - `GET /api/remediation/workflows/{workflow_id}`: Get a specific remediation workflow
  - `POST /api/remediation/workflows/{workflow_id}/step/{step_id}/approve`: Approve a workflow step
  - `POST /api/remediation/workflows/{workflow_id}/step/{step_id}/reject`: Reject a workflow step
  - `POST /api/remediation/rollback/{operation_id}/execute`: Execute a rollback operation
  - `GET /api/remediation/rollback/{operation_id}/status`: Get rollback operation status

### API Implementation
- Use FastAPI for implementing the endpoints
- Implement proper request and response models
- Add validation for request parameters
- Include error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Add filtering and sorting options for list endpoints
- Include proper documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

### Integration with Services
- Integrate with the remediation service for plan and action management
- Integrate with the workflow service for workflow management
- Integrate with the approval service for approval management
- Integrate with the rollback service for rollback management

### Security
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Add logging for audit purposes

### API Router Integration
- Register the remediation API endpoints with the existing API router
- Ensure proper URL prefixing and versioning
- Maintain consistency with existing API patterns

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/api/remediation_api.py`: The file to implement
- `services/security-enforcement/api/router.py`: The API router to integrate with
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Service for remediation functionality
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Service for workflow functionality
- `services/security-enforcement/services/approval_service.py`: Service for approval functionality
- `services/security-enforcement/services/rollback_service.py`: Service for rollback functionality
- `services/security-enforcement/models/remediation.py`: Data models for the API

## Expected Outcome
A well-designed and implemented `remediation_api.py` file containing all the necessary API endpoints for the Automated Remediation system. The API should be RESTful, well-documented, and integrate seamlessly with the existing API router. It should provide a comprehensive interface to all the functionality of the Automated Remediation system.

## Testing
- Ensure all API endpoints have appropriate unit tests
- Test the API endpoints with various input scenarios
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Test integration with the services
- Confirm that the API endpoints work correctly with the existing API router
