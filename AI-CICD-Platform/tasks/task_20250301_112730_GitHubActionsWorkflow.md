# Task: Create GitHub Actions Workflow for CI/CD

## Background

The AI CI/CD Platform project is currently in the initial setup phase. All core services (Frontend Dashboard, API Gateway, AI Pipeline Generator, Security Enforcement, Self-Healing Debugger) have been scaffolded with their basic structure, and the docker-compose.yml is configured for local development. The next logical step is to set up continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Task Description

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:

1. Runs tests for all services
2. Performs code linting and formatting checks
3. Builds the frontend application
4. Generates test coverage reports

## Requirements

- Set up separate jobs for each service
- Configure appropriate Node.js and Python environments
- Include caching for dependencies to speed up workflow runs
- Set up proper test reporting and coverage visualization
- Ensure the workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to main branch

## Relevant Files and Directories

- `services/frontend-dashboard/`: React/TypeScript frontend
- `services/api-gateway/`: API Gateway service
- `services/ai-pipeline-generator/`: AI Pipeline Generator service
- `services/security-enforcement/`: Security Enforcement service
- `services/self-healing-debugger/`: Self-Healing Debugger service
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional GitHub Actions workflow file that automates testing, linting, and building of all services in the AI CI/CD Platform.

## Additional Context

The README mentions a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD, but it doesn't exist yet. This task will implement that workflow to ensure code quality as development progresses.
