# Task: Implement Remediation Data Models

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:03:00

## Background
As part of the Automated Remediation feature, we need to implement the data models that will be used by the remediation system. These models will define the structure of remediation actions, plans, requests, and results, and will be used by the remediation service, workflow system, and API endpoints.

## Task Description
Implement the data models for the Automated Remediation system in the `models/remediation.py` file. These models should provide a clear and consistent structure for representing remediation data throughout the system.

## Requirements

### Core Data Models
- Implement the following data models:
  - `RemediationAction`: Represents a specific remediation action for a vulnerability
  - `RemediationPlan`: Represents a plan containing multiple remediation actions
  - `RemediationRequest`: Represents a request to create a remediation plan
  - `RemediationResult`: Represents the result of executing a remediation action
  - `RemediationStrategy`: Enum defining different remediation strategies (AUTOMATED, MANUAL, HYBRID)
  - `RemediationStatus`: Enum defining different statuses for remediation actions and plans
  - `RemediationSource`: Enum defining different sources of remediation actions (TEMPLATE, CUSTOM, AI_GENERATED)

### Model Functionality
- Each model should include:
  - Proper type hints for all attributes
  - Validation logic for input data
  - Serialization methods (`to_dict()`) for converting to JSON/dictionary
  - Deserialization methods (`from_dict()`) for creating from JSON/dictionary
  - Appropriate default values for optional attributes
  - Clear documentation for all attributes and methods

### Integration with Other Components
- Ensure the models are compatible with:
  - The remediation service
  - The workflow system
  - The approval system
  - The rollback system
  - The API endpoints

### Extensibility
- Design the models to be extensible for future enhancements
- Include support for metadata to allow for additional attributes without changing the model structure
- Use inheritance where appropriate to promote code reuse

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/models/remediation.py`: The file to implement
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Service that will use these models
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Workflow system that will use these models
- `services/security-enforcement/services/approval_service.py`: Approval system that will use these models
- `services/security-enforcement/services/rollback_service.py`: Rollback system that will use these models
- `services/security-enforcement/api/remediation_api.py`: API endpoints that will use these models

## Expected Outcome
A well-designed and implemented `remediation.py` file containing all the necessary data models for the Automated Remediation system. The models should be well-documented, properly typed, and include all the required functionality for serialization, deserialization, and validation.

## Testing
- Ensure all models have appropriate unit tests
- Verify that the models can be serialized and deserialized correctly
- Test the validation logic to ensure it correctly handles invalid input
- Confirm that the models work correctly with the existing services and components
