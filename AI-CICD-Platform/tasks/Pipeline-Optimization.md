# Task: Pipeline Optimization

## Generated on: 2025-03-01 14:11:16

## Background
The AI Pipeline Generator currently creates CI/CD pipelines based on project structure and requirements. However, these pipelines are not always optimized for performance, resource usage, or execution time. Implementing pipeline optimization capabilities will enhance the platform's efficiency by generating pipelines that execute faster, use fewer resources, and provide better overall performance.
