# Task: Automated Remediation

## Generated on: 2025-03-01 13:59:19

## Background
The Security Enforcement component currently provides vulnerability detection and policy enforcement capabilities. However, it lacks automated remediation features that can automatically fix or mitigate detected security issues. Implementing automated remediation will enhance the platform's security posture by reducing the time between vulnerability detection and resolution, minimizing the window of exposure to potential threats.

## Task Description
Implement Automated Remediation capabilities by:

1. Developing a remediation engine that can automatically fix common security vulnerabilities
2. Creating remediation workflows for different types of security issues
3. Implementing approval mechanisms for security patches
4. Adding rollback capabilities for applied remediation
5. Developing integration with the policy engine for policy-driven remediation

## Requirements
### Remediation Engine
- Implement auto-fix capabilities for common vulnerabilities (dependency issues, misconfigurations, etc.)
- Create a plugin architecture for different remediation strategies
- Develop remediation templates for common security issues
- Add support for custom remediation scripts
- Implement remediation verification mechanisms

### Remediation Workflows
- Create workflow definitions for different vulnerability types
- Implement staged remediation for complex issues
- Add support for manual intervention points in workflows
- Develop notification mechanisms for workflow status
- Create audit logging for remediation actions

### Approval Mechanisms
- Implement approval workflows for security patches
- Create role-based approval permissions
- Add support for automated approvals based on policy rules
- Develop approval notifications and reminders
- Implement approval audit logging

### Rollback Capabilities
- Create snapshot mechanisms before applying remediation
- Implement rollback procedures for failed remediation
- Add support for partial rollbacks
- Develop rollback verification
- Create rollback audit logging

### Policy Integration
- Integrate with the policy engine for policy-driven remediation
- Implement policy-based approval rules
- Create policy compliance verification after remediation
- Add support for policy exceptions during remediation
- Develop policy-based prioritization for remediation actions

- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Main remediation service
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Remediation workflow definitions
- `services/security-enforcement/services/approval_service.py`: Approval mechanism implementation
- `services/security-enforcement/services/rollback_service.py`: Rollback capability implementation

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive automated remediation system that:
- Automatically fixes or mitigates common security vulnerabilities
- Provides structured workflows for different types of security issues
- Includes approval mechanisms for security patches
- Offers rollback capabilities for applied remediation
- Integrates with the policy engine for policy-driven remediation

This automated remediation capability will significantly enhance the platform's security posture by reducing the time between vulnerability detection and resolution, minimizing the window of exposure to potential threats, and ensuring that security issues are addressed consistently and effectively.
