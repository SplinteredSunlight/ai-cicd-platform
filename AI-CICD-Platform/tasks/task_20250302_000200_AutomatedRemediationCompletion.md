# Task: Complete Automated Remediation Implementation

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:02:00

## Background
The Automated Remediation feature has been partially implemented with core services and test files. The following components have been created:

- Test files for all components (`test_remediation_templates.py`, `test_remediation_workflows.py`, `test_approval_service.py`, `test_rollback_service.py`)
- Service implementations (`remediation_service.py`, `approval_service.py`, `rollback_service.py`, `remediation_workflows.py`)

To complete the implementation, we need to implement the remaining components, integrate them with the existing system, and create documentation.

## Task Description
Complete the Automated Remediation implementation by:

1. Implementing the remediation templates system
2. Implementing the data models
3. Implementing the API endpoints
4. Updating the main service
5. Creating documentation
6. Adding integration tests

## Requirements

### Remediation Templates System
- Implement `templates/remediation_templates.py` to define templates for common vulnerabilities
- Create template types for dependency updates, code fixes, and configuration updates
- Implement template loading and management
- Add support for custom templates

### Data Models
- Implement `models/remediation.py` to define the data models for remediation actions, plans, and results
- Create serialization/deserialization methods
- Add validation logic

### API Endpoints
- Implement `api/remediation_api.py` to expose the remediation capabilities through a RESTful API
- Create endpoints for:
  - Creating remediation plans
  - Executing remediation actions
  - Managing approvals
  - Handling rollbacks
  - Monitoring remediation status
- Integrate with the existing API router

### Main Service Integration
- Update `main.py` to initialize and register the new remediation services
- Add configuration options for the remediation system
- Implement service discovery and dependency injection

### Documentation
- Update the README.md with information about the new remediation capabilities
- Add examples of how to use the remediation API
- Document the remediation workflow process
- Create diagrams for the remediation system architecture

### Integration Testing
- Create integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality
- Test the interaction between different components
- Verify the remediation workflow process
- Test the API endpoints

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/templates/remediation_templates.py`: Remediation templates implementation
- `services/security-enforcement/models/remediation.py`: Remediation data models
- `services/security-enforcement/api/remediation_api.py`: Remediation API endpoints
- `services/security-enforcement/main.py`: Main service file
- `services/security-enforcement/README.md`: Documentation
- `services/security-enforcement/tests/`: Test directory

## Expected Outcome
A complete and fully functional Automated Remediation system that:
- Automatically fixes or mitigates common security vulnerabilities
- Provides structured workflows for different types of security issues
- Includes approval mechanisms for security patches
- Offers rollback capabilities for applied remediation
- Integrates with the policy engine for policy-driven remediation
- Is well-documented and tested

The system should be fully integrated with the existing Security Enforcement component and ready for production use.
