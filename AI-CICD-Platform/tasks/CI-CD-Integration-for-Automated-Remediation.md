# Task: CI/CD Integration for Automated Remediation

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:32:00

## Background
The Automated Remediation system has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested with comprehensive integration tests. The system can identify vulnerabilities, create remediation plans, execute remediation actions, and handle approvals and rollbacks. However, to maximize its effectiveness, it needs to be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and remediate vulnerabilities during the build and deployment process.

## Task Description
Implement CI/CD integration for the Automated Remediation system to enable automated vulnerability scanning and remediation as part of the continuous integration and deployment process.

## Requirements

### CI Pipeline Integration
- Modify the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to include vulnerability scanning
- Add a step to generate remediation plans for detected vulnerabilities
- Implement automatic remediation for non-critical vulnerabilities
- Add approval workflows for critical vulnerabilities
- Ensure the CI pipeline fails if critical vulnerabilities are detected and cannot be automatically remediated

### Deployment Integration
- Integrate the Automated Remediation system with the deployment automation service
- Implement pre-deployment vulnerability scanning
- Add post-deployment verification to ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced
- Create rollback mechanisms if vulnerabilities are detected after deployment

### Security Gates
- Implement security gates at different stages of the CI/CD pipeline
- Define vulnerability severity thresholds for each gate
- Configure automatic approvals based on security policies
- Add manual approval workflows for exceptions

### Reporting and Notifications
- Generate vulnerability reports during the CI/CD process
- Implement notification mechanisms for detected vulnerabilities
- Add dashboards for monitoring remediation status
- Create audit logs for compliance purposes

### Configuration and Customization
- Add configuration options for CI/CD integration
- Implement customizable security policies
- Create templates for different types of projects
- Add documentation for CI/CD integration

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow file
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Main remediation service
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Remediation workflow definitions
- `services/security-enforcement/api/remediation_api.py`: Remediation API endpoints
- `services/deployment-automation/services/deployment_pipeline_generator.py`: Deployment pipeline generator
- `services/deployment-automation/api/routes/pipelines.py`: Deployment pipeline API routes
- `services/security-enforcement/services/policy_engine.py`: Policy engine for security policies
- `services/security-enforcement/templates/remediation_templates.py`: Remediation templates

## Expected Outcome
A fully integrated CI/CD pipeline that automatically detects vulnerabilities, generates remediation plans, and executes remediation actions as part of the build and deployment process. The integration should be configurable, with appropriate security gates and approval workflows, and should provide comprehensive reporting and notification mechanisms.
