# Task Prompts for Cline

This directory contains task prompt files generated by the AI Task Manager for use with Cline in VS Code.

## How to Use

1. When you complete a task using the "New Cline Task" command, a new markdown file will be created in this directory.
2. The file will contain:
   - Instructions for using the prompt
   - The complete task prompt for the next task
3. To use the prompt:
   - Copy the content below the instructions section
   - Start a new Cline conversation
   - Paste the content to begin the new task

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the following convention:

```
task_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_TaskName.md
```

Where:
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` is the timestamp when the file was created
- `TaskName` is the name of the task

## Benefits

Using this approach provides several benefits:

1. **Lower API Costs**: By starting a new Cline conversation for each task, you avoid accumulating a large conversation history that increases API costs.
2. **Better Organization**: Each task is clearly separated in its own file.
3. **Improved Context**: The task prompt includes all necessary context for the task.
4. **Task History**: You can review previous task prompts to see what was accomplished.

## Command Line Usage

You can generate these files using the command line:

```bash
# Complete current task and create a new Cline task file
./task new-cline

# With a specific template
./task new-cline --template detailed

# For a specific sub-task
./task new-cline --sub-task "Sub-Task Name"
```

Or use the VS Code task "Task: New Cline Task" from the Command Palette.
