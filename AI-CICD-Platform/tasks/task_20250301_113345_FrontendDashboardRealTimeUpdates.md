# Task: Implement Frontend Dashboard Real-time Updates

## Background

The AI CI/CD Platform needs real-time updates in the Frontend Dashboard to provide immediate feedback on pipeline status, security issues, and debugging information without requiring page refreshes. The WebSocket infrastructure is partially in place, with the API Gateway having a `websocket_service.py` and the Frontend Dashboard having a `websocket.service.ts` and related test files.

## Task Description

Implement real-time updates for the Frontend Dashboard by:

1. Enhancing the API Gateway's WebSocket service to broadcast events from other services
2. Implementing event publishing from the Self-Healing Debugger, Security Enforcement, and AI Pipeline Generator
3. Completing the WebSocket service in the frontend
4. Creating React hooks for WebSocket subscriptions
5. Implementing real-time updating components for the dashboard

## Requirements

### Backend WebSocket Enhancement

- Expand the API Gateway's WebSocket service:
  - Add event types for different services
  - Implement broadcasting mechanism
  - Create authentication for WebSocket connections
- Add event publishing to other services:
  - Self-Healing Debugger: Publish debug events, error detections, and patch applications
  - Security Enforcement: Publish vulnerability detections and scan completions
  - AI Pipeline Generator: Publish pipeline generation and optimization events

### Frontend Integration

- Complete the WebSocket service in the frontend:
  - Add connection management
  - Implement reconnection logic
  - Create message parsing and routing
- Create React hooks for WebSocket subscriptions:
  - `useWebSocketEvent` hook for subscribing to specific event types
  - `useWebSocketConnection` hook for connection status
- Implement real-time updating components:
  - Live pipeline status widget
  - Security alerts component
  - Debugging activity feed

### Testing

- Backend tests:
  - Unit tests for WebSocket message handling
  - Integration tests for event publishing
- Frontend tests:
  - Unit tests for WebSocket service
  - Component tests for real-time updating widgets
  - Mock WebSocket server for testing

### Documentation

- Update API documentation with WebSocket endpoints
- Add developer documentation for the event system
- Update user documentation with real-time features

## Relevant Files and Directories

- `services/api-gateway/services/websocket_service.py`: API Gateway WebSocket service
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/services/websocket.service.ts`: Frontend WebSocket service
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/__tests__/services/websocket.service.test.ts`: WebSocket service tests
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/__tests__/stores/websocket.integration.test.tsx`: WebSocket integration tests
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/stores/dashboard.store.ts`: Dashboard store for state management
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/components/dashboard/`: Dashboard components

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional real-time update system that provides immediate feedback on pipeline status, security issues, and debugging information without requiring page refreshes.

## Additional Context

This task aligns with the Frontend Dashboard Enhancements section of the project plan, specifically the "Real-time Updates" item. It will significantly enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback on system activities.
