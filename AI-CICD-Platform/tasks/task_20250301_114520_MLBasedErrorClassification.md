# Task: Implement ML-Based Error Classification for Self-Healing Debugger

## Background

The Self-Healing Debugger component currently detects errors and generates patches, but it lacks advanced classification capabilities. As mentioned in the project roadmap, we need to implement ML-Based Error Classification to better categorize errors and suggest fixes. This will enhance the debugger's ability to identify patterns and provide more accurate solutions.

## Task Description

Implement ML-Based Error Classification for the Self-Healing Debugger by:

1. Enhancing the ML classifier model to categorize CI/CD pipeline errors
2. Integrating the classifier with the existing error detection system
3. Implementing confidence scoring for classification results
4. Adding real-time classification updates via WebSocket events
5. Creating unit and integration tests for the new functionality

## Requirements

### ML Classifier Enhancement

- Expand the existing `ml_classifier.py` model to support more error categories
- Implement feature extraction from error logs and stack traces
- Add support for confidence scoring in classification results
- Implement model training and evaluation functionality

### Integration with Error Detection

- Update the log analyzer to use the ML classifier for error categorization
- Modify the auto patcher to leverage classification results for better patch generation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing error detection mechanisms

### Real-time Updates

- Integrate with the WebSocket service to publish classification results
- Implement event emission for ML classification events
- Ensure proper formatting of classification data for frontend consumption

### Testing

- Create unit tests for the ML classifier
- Add integration tests for the end-to-end classification workflow
- Implement test fixtures with sample error logs and expected classifications

## Relevant Files and Directories

- `services/self-healing-debugger/models/ml_classifier.py`: ML classifier model
- `services/self-healing-debugger/services/log_analyzer.py`: Log analysis service
- `services/self-healing-debugger/services/ml_classifier_service.py`: Service for ML classification
- `services/self-healing-debugger/tests/test_ml_classifier.py`: Tests for ML classifier
- `services/self-healing-debugger/tests/test_ml_integration.py`: Integration tests
- `services/api-gateway/services/websocket_service.py`: WebSocket service for real-time updates

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional ML-based error classification system that:
- Accurately categorizes CI/CD pipeline errors
- Provides confidence scores for classifications
- Suggests potential fixes based on classification results
- Integrates with the WebSocket service for real-time updates
- Is thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests

## Additional Context

This task aligns with the "ML-Based Error Classification" item in the project roadmap. It will significantly enhance the Self-Healing Debugger's capabilities by providing more accurate error categorization and fix suggestions.
