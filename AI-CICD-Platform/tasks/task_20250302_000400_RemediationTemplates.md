# Task: Implement Remediation Templates System

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:04:00

## Background
The remediation templates system is a critical component of the Automated Remediation feature. It provides predefined templates for common security vulnerabilities, allowing the system to automatically generate remediation actions. The templates system needs to be flexible, extensible, and support various types of vulnerabilities.

## Task Description
Implement the remediation templates system in the `templates/remediation_templates.py` file. This system should provide a framework for defining, loading, and managing remediation templates for different types of security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### Template Types
- Implement the following template types:
  - `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE`: Templates for updating vulnerable dependencies
  - `CODE_FIX`: Templates for fixing vulnerable code patterns
  - `CONFIG_UPDATE`: Templates for updating misconfigurations
  - `CUSTOM`: Templates for custom remediation actions

### Template Structure
- Each template should include:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name and description
  - Template type
  - Applicable vulnerability types
  - Remediation steps with actions and parameters
  - Variables for customization
  - Metadata for additional information

### Template Management
- Implement a `RemediationTemplate` class for representing templates
- Implement a `RemediationTemplateService` for managing templates:
  - Loading templates from files
  - Retrieving templates by ID or vulnerability type
  - Creating remediation actions from templates
  - Validating templates
  - Supporting custom templates

### Template Customization
- Support variable substitution in templates
- Allow for conditional steps based on context
- Support template inheritance and composition
- Provide hooks for custom logic

### Built-in Templates
- Implement built-in templates for common vulnerabilities:
  - Dependency update templates for npm, pip, etc.
  - Code fix templates for common security issues
  - Configuration update templates for common misconfigurations

### Integration with Other Components
- Ensure the templates system integrates with:
  - The remediation service
  - The workflow system
  - The data models

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/templates/remediation_templates.py`: The file to implement
- `services/security-enforcement/models/remediation.py`: Data models used by the templates
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Service that will use the templates
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Workflow system that will use the templates
- `services/security-enforcement/tests/test_remediation_templates.py`: Tests for the templates system

## Expected Outcome
A well-designed and implemented `remediation_templates.py` file containing the remediation templates system. The system should be flexible, extensible, and include built-in templates for common vulnerabilities. It should integrate seamlessly with the other components of the Automated Remediation feature.

## Testing
- Ensure all template classes and services have appropriate unit tests
- Verify that templates can be loaded and managed correctly
- Test the template customization features
- Confirm that the templates system works correctly with the existing services and components
