# Task: Dependency Analysis

## Generated on: 2025-03-01 14:12:19

## Background
The AI Pipeline Generator currently creates CI/CD pipelines based on basic project analysis. However, it lacks sophisticated dependency analysis capabilities that can identify complex relationships between different components of a project. Implementing advanced dependency analysis will enhance the platform's ability to generate more accurate and efficient pipelines that properly handle dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

## Task Description
Implement Dependency Analysis capabilities by:

1. Developing advanced code analysis tools to identify dependencies between components
2. Creating dependency graph visualization for better understanding of project structure
3. Implementing impact analysis to determine the effects of code changes
4. Adding build order optimization based on dependency analysis
5. Developing integration with package managers for external dependency analysis

## Requirements
### Code Analysis
- Implement static code analysis for multiple programming languages
- Create call graph analysis to identify function/method dependencies
- Develop import/include statement analysis
- Add class hierarchy and inheritance analysis
- Implement data flow analysis

### Dependency Graph Visualization
- Create visual representation of project dependencies
- Implement interactive dependency graphs
- Add filtering and search capabilities for large graphs
- Develop different views (component-level, file-level, function-level)
- Create dependency metrics and statistics

### Impact Analysis
- Implement change impact prediction
- Create affected component identification
- Develop risk assessment for code changes
- Add test coverage recommendation based on changes
- Implement historical change pattern analysis

### Build Order Optimization
- Create topological sorting of dependencies
- Implement critical path analysis for build processes
- Add parallel build opportunity identification
- Develop incremental build optimization
- Create build time prediction based on dependencies

### Package Manager Integration
- Implement integration with npm, pip, Maven, etc.
- Create transitive dependency analysis
- Add vulnerability scanning for external dependencies
- Develop dependency version optimization
- Implement license compliance checking

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive dependency analysis system that:
- Accurately identifies dependencies between different components of a project
- Provides clear visualization of dependency relationships
- Determines the potential impact of code changes
- Optimizes build order based on dependency analysis
- Integrates with package managers for external dependency analysis

This dependency analysis capability will significantly enhance the platform's ability to generate more accurate and efficient pipelines, ensuring that builds are performed in the correct order, tests are run on affected components, and developers have a clear understanding of the relationships between different parts of the codebase.
