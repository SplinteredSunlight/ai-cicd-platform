# Task: Implement Main Service Integration and Documentation

## Generated on: 2025-03-02 00:06:00

## Background
The Automated Remediation feature requires integration with the main security enforcement service and comprehensive documentation. This integration will make the remediation capabilities available to the rest of the system, while the documentation will help users understand and utilize these capabilities.

## Task Description
Implement the main service integration in the `main.py` file and create comprehensive documentation for the Automated Remediation feature.

## Requirements

### Main Service Integration
- Update `main.py` to:
  - Initialize and register the remediation services
  - Initialize and register the approval service
  - Initialize and register the rollback service
  - Initialize and register the workflow service
  - Initialize and register the templates service
  - Register the remediation API endpoints with the API router
  - Add configuration options for the remediation system
  - Implement service discovery and dependency injection

### Configuration
- Add configuration options for:
  - Templates directory
  - Data storage directories
  - Approval settings
  - Rollback settings
  - Workflow settings
  - API settings

### Service Initialization
- Implement proper initialization order for services
- Handle dependencies between services
- Implement error handling for service initialization
- Add logging for service initialization

### Documentation
- Update the README.md with:
  - Overview of the Automated Remediation feature
  - Architecture diagram
  - Component descriptions
  - API documentation
  - Usage examples
  - Configuration options
  - Troubleshooting guide

### Integration Testing
- Create integration tests to verify:
  - Service initialization
  - API endpoint registration
  - Configuration loading
  - End-to-end functionality

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/main.py`: The main service file to update
- `services/security-enforcement/README.md`: The documentation file to update
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_service.py`: Remediation service to integrate
- `services/security-enforcement/services/approval_service.py`: Approval service to integrate
- `services/security-enforcement/services/rollback_service.py`: Rollback service to integrate
- `services/security-enforcement/services/remediation_workflows.py`: Workflow service to integrate
- `services/security-enforcement/templates/remediation_templates.py`: Templates service to integrate
- `services/security-enforcement/api/remediation_api.py`: API endpoints to register
- `services/security-enforcement/api/router.py`: API router to integrate with

## Expected Outcome
A fully integrated Automated Remediation system that is properly initialized and registered with the main security enforcement service, along with comprehensive documentation that helps users understand and utilize the system's capabilities.

## Testing
- Test the service initialization and registration
- Verify that the API endpoints are properly registered
- Test the configuration loading
- Verify that the services can communicate with each other
- Test the end-to-end functionality
