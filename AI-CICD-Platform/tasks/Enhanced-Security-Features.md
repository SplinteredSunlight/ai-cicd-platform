# Task: Enhanced Security Features

## Generated on: 2025-03-01 12:13:53

## Background
The Self-Healing Debugger currently provides basic error detection and patching capabilities, enhanced by our newly implemented ML-based error classification. However, the user interface for interacting with the debugging process needs improvement to provide better real-time feedback and visualization of the debugging process.

## Task Description
Enhance the Interactive Debugging UI by:

1. Implementing a real-time visualization dashboard for error analysis
2. Creating interactive components for reviewing and applying patches
3. Developing a timeline view of debugging activities
4. Adding detailed views for ML classification results
5. Implementing user feedback mechanisms for patch effectiveness

## Requirements

### Real-time Visualization
- Create components to visualize error patterns and categories
- Implement real-time updates of error detection and classification
- Add visual indicators for confidence scores from ML classification

### Interactive Patch Management
- Develop UI components for reviewing suggested patches
- Create interactive elements for approving, rejecting, or modifying patches
- Implement visual feedback for patch application status

### Timeline View
- Create a chronological view of debugging activities
- Implement filtering and searching capabilities
- Add the ability to replay debugging sessions

### ML Classification Results Display
- Design detailed views for ML classification outputs
- Implement visualizations for confidence scores and alternative classifications
- Create UI for comparing ML classifications with traditional pattern matching

### User Feedback System
- Implement mechanisms for users to rate patch effectiveness
- Create interfaces for submitting corrections to ML classifications
- Develop a system to incorporate user feedback into ML model training

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/components/dashboard/DebugActivityFeed.tsx`: Main debugging activity feed
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/components/dashboard/PatchReviewPanel.tsx`: Panel for reviewing patches
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`: WebSocket hook for real-time updates
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/services/websocket.service.ts`: WebSocket service
- `services/frontend-dashboard/src/pages/DebuggerPage.tsx`: Main debugger page
- `services/api-gateway/services/websocket_service.py`: Backend WebSocket service

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional interactive debugging UI that:
- Provides clear visualization of error detection and classification
- Offers intuitive interfaces for patch management
- Displays a comprehensive timeline of debugging activities
- Shows detailed ML classification results with confidence scores
- Allows users to provide feedback on patch effectiveness and ML classifications

This enhancement will significantly improve the user experience when working with the Self-Healing Debugger, making it more transparent, interactive, and effective.
