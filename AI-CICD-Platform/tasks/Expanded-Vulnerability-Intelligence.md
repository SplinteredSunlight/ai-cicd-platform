# Task: Expanded Vulnerability Intelligence

## Generated on: 2025-03-01 12:15:24

## Background
The Security Enforcement component currently integrates with a limited set of vulnerability databases. To provide more comprehensive security coverage, we need to expand our vulnerability intelligence capabilities by integrating with additional vulnerability databases and threat intelligence sources. This will enhance our ability to detect and remediate a wider range of security issues.

## Task Description
Implement Expanded Vulnerability Intelligence by:

1. Integrating with additional vulnerability databases and threat intelligence sources
2. Enhancing vulnerability metadata enrichment capabilities
3. Implementing vulnerability prioritization based on multiple factors
4. Creating a unified vulnerability data model across all sources
5. Developing a vulnerability intelligence API for internal and external consumption

## Requirements
### Additional Integrations
- Integrate with MITRE CVE database for comprehensive vulnerability information
- Add support for OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) database
- Implement VulnDB integration for commercial vulnerability intelligence
- Add OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) support
- Integrate with EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)

### Metadata Enrichment
- Enhance vulnerability descriptions with detailed technical information
- Add exploit availability information
- Include remediation guidance from multiple sources
- Implement affected version range determination
- Add vulnerability categorization and tagging

### Vulnerability Prioritization
- Implement CVSS-based prioritization
- Add exploit availability as a prioritization factor
- Include asset value in vulnerability risk calculation
- Consider vulnerability age and patch availability
- Implement machine learning-based prioritization

### Unified Data Model
- Create a comprehensive vulnerability data model
- Implement mapping between different vulnerability schemas
- Develop normalization processes for heterogeneous data
- Create deduplication mechanisms for overlapping vulnerabilities
- Implement data quality assurance processes

### Vulnerability Intelligence API
- Develop a RESTful API for vulnerability data access
- Implement GraphQL support for flexible queries
- Create webhook notifications for new vulnerabilities
- Add bulk export capabilities for integration with other systems
- Implement rate limiting and access controls

## Relevant Files and Directories
- `services/security-enforcement/services/cve_mitre_integration.py`: MITRE CVE integration
- `services/security-enforcement/services/osv_integration.py`: OSV integration
- `services/security-enforcement/services/vulndb_integration.py`: VulnDB integration

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive vulnerability intelligence system that:
- Integrates with multiple vulnerability databases and threat intelligence sources
- Provides rich metadata for each vulnerability
- Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on multiple risk factors
- Offers a unified data model across all vulnerability sources
- Exposes vulnerability data through a flexible API

This expanded vulnerability intelligence will significantly enhance the platform's ability to detect and remediate security issues, providing more comprehensive security coverage and better protection against emerging threats.
